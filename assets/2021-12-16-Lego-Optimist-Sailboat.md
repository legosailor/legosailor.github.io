If you like my F50, maybe you would like your own Lego Optimist!

After building out the F50, I thought other people might like their own Lego sailing boat too. So I designed an Optimist


{% include figure image_path="/assets/opti/opti1.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Thisasdddfffure caption." %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/opti/opti1.png" alt="this is a plasdfslder image" caption="This is a figure caption." %}

Similar to the F50, you can customise this model yourself by printing photo quality stickers for your sail, boat name and display plaque.

I think this model will look great sitting in your room or to be given away as a Regatta trophy!

If you would like to order one, complete with build instructions - get in contact at <mailto:masterbuilder271+optimist@gmail.com>
