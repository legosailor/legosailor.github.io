Hi, I'm Josh. I'm 13 and sail an Optimist out of Connells Point Sailing Club, Sydney. I have been building Lego since forever. Recently I have combined the two!

I started sailing in 2020 at Connells Point Sailing Club as part of their October Learn To sail program.

I've been building Lego though for as long as I can remember.
