Hi, I'm Josh. I'm 13 and sail an Optimist out of Connells Point Sailing Club, Sydney.

I learnt to sail in 2020 through CPSC's Learn to Sail program but have been building Lego since before I can remember!

I build all sorts of models - Star Wars, trains, mechs - and I've entered competitions

Lately I have been building boat models and this site details those builds.

I'll be on the Concord and Ryde SailGP Ferry, Saturday 18th Dec wearing a CPSC/Team Denmark tshirt so if you see me and want to talk all things Lego, say hello!
