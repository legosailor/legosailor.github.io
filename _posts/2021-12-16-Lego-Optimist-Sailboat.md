Since my F50 model worked out so well, I made an optimist

{% include figure image_path="/assets/f50/f50-start.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Tasdfadfption." %}

Then we did this


{% include figure image_path="/assets/opti/opti1.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Thisasdddfffure caption." %}

and that

{% include figure image_path="/assets/opti/opti1.png" alt="this is a plasdfslder image" caption="This is a figure caption." %}

and finall
