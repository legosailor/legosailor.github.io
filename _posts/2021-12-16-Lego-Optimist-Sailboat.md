After building the F50, I designed the boat I've sailed most - an Optimist.


{% include figure image_path="/assets/opti/opti1.png" alt="Rendered Lego Optimist MOC" caption="Optimist MOC render" %}

{% include video id="Nq1MovpCr_Q" provider="youtube" %}

This is a test build to make sure the design works

Like the F50, the model could be customised by printing photo quality stickers for a sail number, boat name and display plaque.
