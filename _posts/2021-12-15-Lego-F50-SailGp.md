I sail at [Connells Point Sailing Club](https://www.facebook.com/ConnellsPointSC/) in Sydney. In November 2021, we found out the club had been selected to be part of the [Adopt-a-Club](https://sailgp.com/news/21/sailgp-adopt-a-club-launches-sydney/) outreach program. This meant we needed to give Team Denmark a big welcome. Any Lego fanatic worth their salt knows that Denmark is the home of Lego, so I put up my hand to make a Lego model of the boat.

Here is how I made it!

There is a Lego CAD program called [Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/build/studio.page) which lets you choose from any brick ever made. It turns out this can be an issue when you accidentally pick a piece that was last made in 1972 yet looks exactly like one made in 2021.

I'd never heard of these boats before so after studying a lot of F50 pictures and watching some YouTube videos, I built up the model in CAD. I have [Lego Technic Catamaran 42105](https://www.target.com.au/p/lego-reg-technic-catamaran-421-5/63370843) which gave me some inspiration for how to model the mast.

The neat thing about Studio is that you can render photo realistic images. It was at this point, the club realised I have been building Lego a lot longer than I have been sailing ;)

Designing the sail was quite tricky until I found out it was a rigid wing that could be made out of layered plates. After a lot of tuning and tweaking and with time running out, I exported the parts list to [bricklink.com](https://www.bricklink.com) and ordered the parts

This is where it's really important to make sure you build the model out of 2021 Lego parts, not the 1972 equivalent. Those 1972 parts are very hard to find! So after running through the parts list a few times, I found all the problem parts and resubmitted.
Even still, the red 12 x 3 wedges for the nose of the hull was last produced in 2016 which makes them relatively rare.


Over the next few weeks, parts started to arrive but it wasn't until the last few packages came that the build could properly start.

Since the design was all in Studio, it generates the instructions automatically which comes in handy. You still need to hand edit some instructions so they make sense though.

To make the boat look really good, it needed some decals. Normally these come ready made in Lego sets, no such luck with this model! Luckily Team Denmark sent our club the viking files for making some Team Den t-shirts which were very useful. Creating the sail decals would have been really hard to do without those files.
The other logos were found on the internet - apart from the Rolex on the jib which was recreated in Paint.NET.

By now the model was looking pretty good

The last thing to do was the jib. Do you know the saying "measure twice, cut once"? In the case of the jib it was more like measure 3 times, cut 3 times.

Finished model, just in time for Sydney SailGP weekend!

The final model is 

* 368 parts
* 488 grams
* 42 cm high
* 30 cm long
* 20 cm wide
